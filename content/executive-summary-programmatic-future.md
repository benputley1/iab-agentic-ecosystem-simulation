# Executive Summary: The Future of Programmatic Trading

*Key findings and recommendations from a 30-day simulation comparing three models for programmatic advertising.*

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes findings from a 30-day simulation comparing three models for programmatic advertising: traditional exchange-based trading, pure agent-to-agent (A2A) trading, and ledger-backed direct trading.

## Key Numbers

- **$67,961.84** extracted by exchange intermediaries
- **32** context loss events in pure A2A model
- **7** decisions based on fabricated data
- **$0.49** total ledger infrastructure cost
- **100%** cost savings with ledger model

## Top Findings

### Ledger Model Cuts Costs by 100%

The ledger-backed trading model (Scenario C) reduced transaction costs by $67,961.35 compared to traditional exchange-based trading. This represents a 100% reduction in overhead.

### Memory Loss Led to 7 Fabricated Decisions

Following context loss events, agents made 7 decisions based on hallucinated data. Without ground truth verification, these errors went undetected.

### 15.0% of Every Ad Dollar Goes to Intermediaries

Our simulation revealed that traditional ad exchanges extract 15.0% of every transaction. Over 31 days, this amounted to $67,961.84 in intermediary fees.

### Agent Memory Loss Caused 32 Incidents

The pure agent-to-agent model (Scenario B) experienced 32 context loss events over the simulation period. Without persistent state, agents cannot recover lost information.

### 100% Transaction Auditability with Immutable Ledger

The ledger-backed model recorded all 478 transactions to an immutable ledger, enabling complete auditability and dispute resolution.

## Recommendations

Based on simulation results, we recommend:

1. **Evaluate ledger-backed trading** for cost savings and transparency
2. **Implement state persistence** for any agent-based system
3. **Deploy ground truth verification** to detect hallucinations
4. **Audit current exchange fees** against delivered value

## Next Steps
