# The Hidden Tax of Programmatic Advertising

*How much do ad tech intermediaries really extract from programmatic transactions? Our simulation reveals the true cost of exchange-based trading.*

## The Exchange Tax

Every programmatic advertising transaction that flows through a traditional exchange is subject to an invisible tax. Our simulation quantified this cost.

Over 31 simulated days of advertising activity, the exchange-based model (Scenario A) processed $453,078.93 in transactions. Of that amount, **$67,961.84** was extracted by the exchange - a **15.0% take rate** on every deal.

## Where Does the Money Go?

When an advertiser pays $100 for impressions in the exchange model:

- **$85.00** goes to the publisher
- **$15.00** goes to the exchange

This intermediary fee represents infrastructure cost, but is it justified?

## The Alternative: Ledger-Backed Trading

The ledger-backed model (Scenario C) processed a similar volume of transactions ($442,687.36) with infrastructure costs of just **$0.49** - that's **0.0001%** of transaction volume.

### Ledger Model Cuts Costs by 100%

The ledger-backed trading model (Scenario C) reduced transaction costs by $67,961.35 compared to traditional exchange-based trading. This represents a 100% reduction in overhead.

Traditional programmatic advertising relies on exchange intermediaries that extract fees from every transaction. In our simulation, the exchange model (Scenario A) collected $67,961.84 in fees at a 15.0% take rate. The ledger-backed model achieved the same transaction volume with infrastructure costs of just $0.49, a savings of 100%.

**Key Data:**
- Exchange fees (A): 67,961.84
- Blockchain costs (C): 0.49
- Net savings: 67,961.35
- Savings percentage: 100.0%

> Exchange intermediaries extracted $67,961.84 - money that could have gone to publishers or reduced advertiser costs.

### 15.0% of Every Ad Dollar Goes to Intermediaries

Our simulation revealed that traditional ad exchanges extract 15.0% of every transaction. Over 31 days, this amounted to $67,961.84 in intermediary fees.

The rent-seeking exchange model (Scenario A) operates by inserting itself between buyers and sellers, extracting value from each transaction. While this model provides market infrastructure, the cost is substantial. At 15.0% per transaction, a significant portion of advertiser budgets never reaches publishers.

**Key Data:**
- Take rate: 15.0%
- Total fees extracted: 67,961.84
- Total spend: 453,078.93

> For every $100 spent on advertising, $15 goes to the exchange - not to publishers.

## The Bottom Line

Over the simulation period, the ledger-backed model saved **$67,961.35** compared to traditional exchange-based trading. At scale, these savings compound dramatically.

The question isn't whether intermediaries provide value - they do. The question is whether that value is worth 15% of every transaction.
