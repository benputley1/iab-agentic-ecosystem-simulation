# Immutable Ledgers: A New Foundation for Ad Tech

*Blockchain isn't just about cryptocurrency. Immutable ledgers could solve ad tech's transparency and trust problems at a fraction of current costs.*

## Beyond Cryptocurrency

When people hear 'blockchain,' they think cryptocurrency. But the core innovation - an immutable, verifiable ledger - has applications far beyond digital currency.

Our simulation explored what happens when you bring immutable ledgers to programmatic advertising.

## The Trust Problem

Traditional advertising has a trust problem:

- Advertisers must trust exchange reporting
- Publishers must trust payment calculations
- Disputes are resolved by the intermediary who benefits from opacity

## The Ledger Solution

The ledger-backed model (Scenario C) recorded all **478** transactions to an immutable ledger. Every deal has:

- Permanent, tamper-proof record
- Verification accessible to all parties
- Automated dispute resolution
- Complete audit trail

### 100% Transaction Auditability with Immutable Ledger

The ledger-backed model recorded all 478 transactions to an immutable ledger, enabling complete auditability and dispute resolution.

Transparency and verification are critical in advertising. The ledger-backed model (Scenario C) records every transaction to an immutable ledger, creating a permanent, verifiable record. Unlike Scenario A (centralized exchange records) or Scenario B (no persistent records), the ledger provides tamper-proof verification accessible to all parties. This enables automated dispute resolution and eliminates the need to trust intermediary reporting.

**Key Data:**
- Transactions recorded: 478
- Verification accuracy: 100%
- Record permanence: Immutable

> Every transaction is recorded immutably - no disputes about what happened, when, or at what price.

### Blockchain Infrastructure Costs $0.0010 Per Transaction

Recording transactions to the immutable ledger cost just $0.49 total, or $0.0010 per deal - a fraction of exchange fees.

A common concern about blockchain-based systems is infrastructure cost. Our simulation used realistic gas and storage costs based on Sui and Walrus pricing. At $0.0010 per transaction, the total infrastructure cost was $0.49 for 478 deals. Compare this to the $67,961.84 extracted by the exchange model - the ledger approach represents a 100% cost reduction while adding immutability and auditability.

**Key Data:**
- Cost per transaction: $0.0010
- Total infrastructure cost: 0.49
- Transactions processed: 478
- Exchange fees comparison: 67,961.84

> At $0.0010 per transaction, blockchain infrastructure costs less than 1% of traditional exchange fees.

## The Cost Question

Infrastructure cost for the ledger model was **$0.0010** per transaction - total cost of **$0.49** for the entire simulation.

Compare this to the **$67,961.84** extracted by the exchange model. The ledger approach provides transparency and verification at a fraction of the cost.
